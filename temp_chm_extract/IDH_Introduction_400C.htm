<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a variant of acoustic wave microsensors that are capable of ultrasensitive mass measurements. Under favorable conditions, a typical QCM can measure a mass change of 0.1-1 ng/cm</span><sup><span class="ts1">2</span></sup><span class="ts1">.&nbsp; QCM oscillates in a mechanically resonant shear mode under the influence of a high frequency AC electric field which is applied across the thickness of the crystal. Figure 1b below shows an edge view of a QCM crystal undergoing oscillatory shear distortion. The central portions of the top and bottom of the crystal are coated with a typically disk-shaped thin metal film (e.g., gold). The mass sensitivity of the QCM originates from the dependence of the oscillation frequency on the total mass of the metal-coated crystal, including any adlayers of deposited materials, as given by the Sauerbrey equation:</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts1">df = -2f</span><sub><span class="ts1">0</span></sub><sup><span class="ts1">2</span></sup><span class="ts1">&nbsp;dm / [A sqrt(</span><span class="ts3">μ</span><span class="ts1">p)]</span></p>
<p class="ps6"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="ts1">where f</span><sub><span class="ts1">0</span></sub><span class="ts1">&nbsp;is the resonant frequency of the fundamental mode of the crystal, A is the area of the gold disk coated onto the crystal, </span><span class="ts3">p</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;is the density of the crystal (= 2.684 g/cm</span><sup><span class="ts1">3</span></sup><span class="ts1">), and </span><span class="ts3">μ</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;is the shear modulus of quartz (= 2.947 x 10</span><sup><span class="ts1">11</span></sup><span class="ts1">&nbsp;g/cm</span><sup><span class="ts4">.</span></sup><span class="ts1">s</span><sup><span class="ts1">2</span></sup><span class="ts1">). For example, using our crystal, which has a 7.995-MHz fundamental frequency, a net change of 1 Hz corresponds to 1.34 ng of mass adsorbed or desorbed onto the crystal surface of an area of 0.196 cm</span><sup><span class="ts1">2</span></sup><span class="ts1">. </span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="ts1">QCM in conjunction with electrochemistry (EQCM) has been widely employed for the determination of metals deposited onto the crystal, studies of ion-transport processes in polymer films, biosensor development, and investigations of the kinetics of adsorption/desorption of adsorbate molecules. In EQCM experiments, measurements of various electrochemical parameters, such as potential, current, and charge at the working electrode, are conducted simultaneously with the acquisition of the corresponding frequency and resistance changes, using the experimental setup shown in Figure 1a.&nbsp; For any model in the 400C series, application of a specific potential waveform (e.g., triangular potential waveform for cyclic voltammetric experiments), current measurement, and frequency counting are carried out with a potentiostat/frequency counter, which is in turn controlled by a computer.</span></p>

<p class="ps7"><span class="ts1">Figure 1. Schematic representation of a typical EQCM instrument. (a) The quartz crystal has a fundamental frequency of 7.995 MHz and is coated with thin gold films on both sides.&nbsp; The gold disk deposited on the top side of the crystal is in contact with the electrolyte solution and used as the working electrode. The top view of the gold-coated crystal is also shown. (b) Edge view of QCM crystal showing shear deformation. The disk thickness and shear deformation have been exaggerated for clarity.</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps7"><span class="ts1">The Model 400C series is a computerized time-resolved electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. They can also be used for general-purpose electrochemical applications. </span><span class="ts1">The model 400</span><span class="ts1">C</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;series contains a quartz crystal oscillator, a fast digital function generator, high</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">resolution</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">and high-speed data acquisition circuitry, a potentiostat, and a galvanostat (Model 440</span><span class="ts1">C</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;only).</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">The QCM is integrated with the potentiostat and galvanostat, to facilitate simple and convenient EQCM</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">studies. Instead of measuring the frequency directly, the 400B series uses a time-resolved mode as</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">follows. The observed frequency signal of the QCM is subtracted from a standard reference frequency,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">and the resulting difference is measured by a reciprocal technique, greatly reducing the required</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">sampling time and yielding much better time resolution for the QCM signal. With direct counting, a 1 Hz</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">QCM resolution requires 1 second of sampling time, 0.1 Hz resolution requires 10 seconds, etc. In</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">contrast, our time-resolved mode allows the QCM signal to be measured in milliseconds with much</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">better resolution.</span></p>
<p class="ps5">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The potential control range of the instrument is ±10 V and the current range is ±250 mA. The instrument</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">is capable of measuring current down to picoamperes. In addition to QCM and EQCM measurements,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">the instrument is capable of a wide range of techniques, and is suitable for general-purpose</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">electrochemical applications. The instrument is very sensitive and very fast, capable of measuring</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">current down to the picoampere level. The instrument provides a very wide dynamic range of</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">experimental time scales. The scan rate in cyclic voltammetry can be up to </span><span class="ts1">1</span><span class="ts1">000 V/s with a 0.1 mV</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">potential increment or 10000 V/s with a 1 mV potential increment.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The multiplexed data acquisition system of the instrument allows an external input, such as a</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">spectroscopy signal, to be recorded simultaneously with electrochemical data. </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows </span><span class="ts1">7/10/11</span><span class="ts1">. It is easy to install and use.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series includes a USB port for data communication with the PC. Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Highly stable 16-bit bias circuitry is used for current and potential bias, allowing a wider dynamic range</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">in AC measurements. This can also be used to re-zero the DC current output.</span></p>
