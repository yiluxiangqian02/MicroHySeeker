<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 1200B series instrument is a computerized hand-held potentiostat/bipotentiostat. The system contains a digital function generator, a data acquisition system, and a potentiostat/bipotentiostat, and it is well suited for electroanalysis and sensor studies. The potential range is ±2.4 V and the current range is ±2 mA. This series is capable of measuring current down to 100 pA. The steady state current of a 10 μm disk electrode can be readily measured. The size of the instrument is 7&quot; (W) 4.5&quot; (D) 1&quot; (H), and it is powered through a USB port, without any need for an AC adapter or batteries. The instrument can be used for electroanalysis and sensor studies. Due to its small size, light weight, and low cost, it is particularly useful for field applications and teaching laboratories.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, context sensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">This model series includes a USB port for data communication with the PC. </span><span class="ts1">Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
