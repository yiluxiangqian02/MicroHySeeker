<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 600F series instrument is a computerized general purpose potentiostat / galvanostat. The Figure below shows the block diagram of the instrument. The system contains a fast digital function generator, dual channel simultaneous 2.5M Hz data acquisition circuitry, a potentiosta</span><span class="ts1">t and a galvanostat (select models). The potential control range is ±10V and the current range is ±250mA. The instrument is capable of measuring current down to picoamperes. The steady state current of a 10 μm disk electrode can be readily measured without</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;external adapters. The instrument provides a very wide dynamic range of experimental time scales. For instance, the scan rate in cyclic voltammetry can be up to 1000V/s with a 0.1mV potential increment or 5000V/s with a 1 mV potential increment. The potentiostat / galvanostat uses a four-electrode configuration and can be used for liquid/liquid interface measurements or to eliminate the effects of connector contact resistance and relays for high current measurements.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Comparing with the previous model 600E series, the new series provide higher speed data acquisition, higher speed of communication, higher frequency impedance measurements, both positive feedback and current interruption iR compensation, and some new techniques, such as Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) and Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT).</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A dockable toolbar allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model uses a USB port for data communication with the PC. Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Highly stable 16-bit bias circuitry is used for current and potential bias, allowing a wider dynamic range in AC measurements. This can also be used to re-zero the DC current output.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series also includes a true integrator for chronocoulometry, and is capable of waveform update at 10 MHz and two channel simultaneous data acquisition at 2.5 MHz with 16-bit resolution and low noise.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Compared with the previous model 600E series, the 600F has faster data acquisition (from 1MHz to 2.5MHz), faster data transfer (3x) between the PC and instrument, higher frequency for impedance measurements (from 1MHz to 3MHz). The current-interrupt iR compensation is added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 600F series can be upgraded to the corresponding 700F series model bipotentiostat with an add-on board. It will therefore be identical to the 600F series when used for single-channel measurements. When used as a bipotentiostat, the second channel can be controlled at a independent constant potential, to scan or step at the same potential as the first channel, or to scan with a constant potential difference with the first channel. Techniques available for the second channel include CV, LSV, SCV, CA, DPV, NPV, SWV, and i-t.</span></p>
