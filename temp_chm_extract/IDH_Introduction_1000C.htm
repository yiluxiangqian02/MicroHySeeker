<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 1000C series instrument is a computerized eight-channel potentiostat. The system contains a digital function generator and multiplexed data acquisition circuitry. The multi-potentiostat can work with eight independent cells or eight working electrodes in the same solution with common reference and counter electrodes. The potential control range is ±10 V for all channels and the current range is ±10 mA. The instrument is capable of measuring current down to picoamperes. Each electrode can be individually controlled, including on/off control, potential, and sensitivity settings; each can be set to an independent potential or the same potential as the primary channel, so that they can sweep or step potentials together with the primary channel.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 1000C series is an upgrade to the model 1000/1000A/1000B series. The instrument allows eight independent cells, simultaneous or sequential measurements, fast waveform generation and data acquisition speed (1 MHz @ 16-bit), and easy software update using flash memory.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">Many electrochemical techniques are available in this model series, including cyclic voltammetry and amperometric i-t measurements, with all eight channels available (except for open circuit potential measurements). The parameters for all channels must be set before running an experiment; you cannot alter parameter settings during experiments. During a run, you can toggle between single and multi-data set display (parallel or overlay plots). After a run, you can choose data from any channel for parallel or overlay plotting.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">This model series includes a USB port for data communication with the PC. Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
