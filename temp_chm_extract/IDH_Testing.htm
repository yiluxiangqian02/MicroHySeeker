<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument was thorougnly tested by our quality assurance team before it was shipped. The &quot;*.bin&quot; files included on the software CD are the data actually acquired with the particular instrument you received.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To test communication between the computer and the instrument, turn the instrument on first, then start the software. Use the Hardware Test command under the Setup menu. If a &ldquo;Link Failed&rdquo; error appears, should check the connection and port settings. Use the System command under the program Setup menu to see if the port setting matches the port in use.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If hardware test results appear on the screen, the PC-instrument communication is working properly. The hardware test results will provide further details regarding the status of your instrument.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To test hardware performance, you can use (say) a 100K ohm resistor as a dummy cell. Short the reference (white) and counter (red) electrode leads and connect the 100K ohm resistor between the red/white clips and working (green) electrode clip. Use the Technique command under the Setup menu and select Cyclic Voltammetry (CV). Use the Parameter command under the Setup menu to set the potential range to be 0.5 V to -0.5 V. The sensitivity can be set to 1e-6 A/V. Run the experiment using the Run command under the Control menu. You should observe a straight line with current from -5e-6 A to +5e-6 A.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To test the instrument with a real electrochemical cell, please prepare a solution of 1 mM ferrocenemethanol in 0.5M KCl. You can use 2mm diameter Pt or Au disk working electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and Pt wire counter electrode. You can run CV from -0.1V to +0.5V and back to -0.1V, using scan rate 0.1V/s and sensitivity 1e-6A/V.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To test software performance, open a data file using the Open command under the File menu to open the test data files included on the software CD. </span><span class="ts5">These are the actual test results for this particular instrument.</span><span class="ts28">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">To open the files, select the files and click OK, or double-click the filename. After reading them in, you can display or process the data. Try the commands under the Graphics and DataProc menus. To revert to the original data and undo all unsaved changes, simply close the file and reload the data with the Open command.</span></p>
