<p class="ps2"><span class="ts36">Section 1: LVD Notes for manual safety issues and protection of instrument against damage</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">1. The unit described in this manual is designed to be operated by trained personnel with a reasonable background knowledge of electrochemistry. Any adjustments, maintenance, or repairs must be carried out as defined by this manual (please refer to Appendix sections above) by a qualified person aware of the hazards involved.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">2. (a) It is essential that operating personnel follow safe working procedures, in addition to the detailed instructions specified in this manual.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">2. (b) The instrument should be placed in a position where the likelihood of the ingress of a chemical spill is kept to an absolute minimum. Efforts should also be made to avoid contact of the instrument with, for instance, corrosive vapours. The electrochemical cell should not be placed on top of the unit due to the risk of leakage and the possibility of the cell contents entering the instrument. If chemicals do enter the unit, switch it off immediately and contact the nearest dealer/CH Instruments, Inc. (contact details at the front of this manual). Routine cleaning of the chassis of the instrument is not necessary. A spill onto the outer casing that does not enter the instrument should be wiped off with a dry cloth, making sure to wipe away from any instrument connections. Likewise, the PC used to operate the instrument should be protected from possible exposure to chemicals.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">2. (c) Despite the customer's best efforts, corrosion of the electrode leads can occur. This condition is best diagnosed by running a CV from -1 V to +1 V on a 1 M Ohm resistor, with sensitivity set to 1e-6. An Ohmic plot through the origin should be obtained, with maximum current of ±1 μA. Working contacts (green and black) are connected to one side of the resistor and counter (aux) and reference (red and white) to the other. Noticeable divergence from this behavior (i.e., linearity through the origin) may suggest faulty leads.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">2. (d) Erroneous data/behavior in an actual electrochemical experiment may be due to factors such as faulty cell connections, poor reference electrode contact, or poor condition of the working electrode. Reference and working electrodes are consumable items and are readily available from CH Instruments, Inc. or your local dealer (see Appendix for a description of the range of accessories available). When a customer uses his/her own electrodes, it is recommended that experimental data be compared against known standards from time to time.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">3. The cover of the instrument should only be removed by qualified personnel at the direction of CH Instruments, Inc..</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">4. Users should always refer to the health and safety data supplied with any chemicals used. Generally accepted laboratory procedures for the safe handling of chemicals should always be employed.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">5. Evidence of any fault condition should immediately be reported to CH Instruments, Inc. or the local distributor as applicable. Hardware faults are usually diagnosed through the instrument's own self test procedure (see Troubleshooting in the Appendix). </span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">6. As the instrument requires a data connection to a PC, we recommend that sufficient space (at least 2 m of linear bench) is set aside in order to avoid cluttering the work area and to ensure easy access to the cell. There should be enough free space around the vents and fan exhaust of the instrument to prevent overheating.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">7. Connections to the cell by crocodile clips should be made in such a way as to avoid shorting of the contacts. </span></p>
