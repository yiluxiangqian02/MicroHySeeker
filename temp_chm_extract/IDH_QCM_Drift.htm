<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">Long term drift is mainly due to temperature effects. This should not be a problem for EQCM studies, most of which are performed on a time scale of seconds or minutes. If you need to study, say, monolayer adsorption for long periods of time, you need to control temperature.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The frequency of the crystal is very sensitive to changes in temperature, particularly if the crystal is in the electrolyte solution. Figure below shows a data file obtained as follows. We put the EQCM cell in a very large thermal bath, starting at room temperature. We tried to control the temperature at 30 degrees C. Initially the temperature rose monotonically. However, we observed large and fast fluctuations in frequency. After 3e4 second, the temperature has settled. For the next 12 hours, the drift was less than 2 Hz.</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">If you do not study electrochemistry during QCM and you need to add samples, you need to obtain a QCM flow cell with a pump and sample injection device. </span></p>
