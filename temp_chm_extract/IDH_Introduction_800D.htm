<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 800D series instrument is designed for electrochemical detection; it can be used for monitoring the current passing through a flow cell in liquid chromatography/electrochemistry or in-flow injection analysis, as well as other electroanalytical applications. The system contains a digital function generator, a data acquisition system, and a potentiostat / bipotentiostat / galvanostat. The potential control range is ±10 V, the current range is ±10 mA, and the maximum sampling rate is 1 MHz at 16-bit resolution. The instrument is capable of measuring current down to picoamperes. This series is intended for analytical use that requires high sensitivity and low noise levels, and its circuitry has very low electrical noise. The instrument allows an external input signal (such as spectroscopic) to be recorded simultaneously with electrochemical measurements. When used for amperometric detection, three decades of current scales are plotted during the experiment to display signals of various magnitudes clearly. Compared with analog instruments, this instrument is much easier to use and also includes standard digital data storage and analysis capabilities, without the need for recorder or baseline adjustments. It also provides a much larger current dynamic range, so that separate runs for large and weak signals are unnecessary. </span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 8×0</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;performs single-channel measurements, while the Model 8×2</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;contains a</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">bipotentiostat for dual-channel measurements, such as rotating ring-disk electrode applications. Dualchannel</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">measurements are also available for CV, LSV, CA, DPV, NPV, SWV, and amperometric i-t</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">techniques. The 2nd channel can be controlled at an independent constant potential, to scan or step at</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">the same potential as the first channel, or to CV scan at a constant potential difference with the first</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">channel.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The 800</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;series has a USB port (default) and a serial port for data communication with the PC. You can</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">select either USB or serial (but not both) by changing a switch setting on the rear panel of the</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">instrument.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Several different models are available in the 800</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;series. Models 800</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/802</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;and 810</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/812</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;are mainly</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">for flow cell detection. Models 820</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/822</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;are intended for voltammetry applications and cannot be used</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">for flow cell detection. Models 830</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/832</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;are comprehensive electrochemical analyzers that can be</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">used for electrochemical detection, voltammetry, and other applications. Models 840</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/842</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;and</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">850</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/852</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;are more advanced models with a galvanostat. Models 850</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">/852</span><span class="ts1">D</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;also include AC</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">voltammetry capabilities.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows </span><span class="ts1">7/10/11</span><span class="ts1">. It is easy to install and use.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signalaveraging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series includes a USB port</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">for data communication with the PC</span><span class="ts1">.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
