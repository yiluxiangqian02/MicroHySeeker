<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument is controlled using software on the PC side, and updates will often be as straightforward as replacing chi####.exe with a newer version. Occasionally, however, the instrument firmware will also need to be updated.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument firmware is now stored in flash memory, allowing it to be distributed electronically rather than through the inconvenient mailing of an EPROM chip. Software and firmware are both available from info@chinstruments.com. Software installation is described in Chapter 2 of this User Manual. Firmware updates are distributed in the form of a hexadecimal file (chi****.hex, where **** is the model number).</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To initiate a firmware update, use the Update Instrument Program command under the File menu to bring up the following dialog box:</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img width="731" height="189" border="0" src="Images/Image(34).png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Click the Browse button to select the appropriate hex file, or type its name and full path in the Filename field.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Click the Update button to upload the hex file to the instrument flash memory. During the upload, please be patient and wait. Please do not activate any other program, and as when updating the firmware/BIOS of any piece of electronics, do not interrupt power to either the PC or the instrument. Any of these actions could cause the upload to fail and corrupt the flash memory, rendering the instrument unusable short of force programming back at the factory. Please contact CH Instruments, Inc. at info@chinstruments.com if this event should occur.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If the upload does not succeed, you will get an error message. In this case, turn the instrument off for 5-10 seconds, then turn it back on. You may need to exit and restart the PC program before trying again.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If the upload is successful, you will get a confirmation message. The updated instrument is now ready to use.</span></p>
