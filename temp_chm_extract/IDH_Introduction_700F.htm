<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 700F series instrument is a computerized general purpose potentiostat / bipotentiostat / galvanostat. Potential applications range from rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments to any applications where dual-channel measurements are essential, such as dual channel electrochemical detection. The model 700F series has the same potentiostat / galvanostat as the model 600F series, but </span><span class="ts1">adds a board that contains the second channel potential control, current measurements including sensitivity switching, two low pass filters, three gain stages, and channel selection. </span><span class="ts3">The Figure below shows the block diagram of the instrument. (Only one current channel is shown; the second channel has the same filtering and gain stages as the primary channel.) The system contains a fast digital function generator, a direct digital synthesizer for high frequency ac waveforms, high-speed dual-channel data acquisition circuitry, a potentiostat / bipotentiostat and a galvanostat (select models). The potential control range is ±10V and the current range is ±250mA. The instrument is capable of measuring current down to picoamperes. The instrument is very fast. The function generator can update at a 10 MHz rate. Two high speed and high resolution data acquisition channels allow both current and potential (or an external voltage signal) to be sampled simultaneously at a rate of 2.5 MHz, with 16-bit resolution. The instrument provides a very wide dynamic range of experimental time scales. For instance, the scan rate in cyclic voltammetry can be up to 1000V/s with a 0.1 mV potential increment or 5000 V/s with a 1 mV potential increment. The potentiostat / galvanostat uses a 4-electrode configuration, allowing it to be used for liquid/liquid interface measurements, and eliminating the effect of the contact resistance of connectors and relays for high current measurements. The data acquisition systems also allow an external input signal (such as spectroscopic) to be recorded simultaneously during an electrochemical measurement. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 700F series is identical to the 600F series when used for single-channel measurements. When used as a bipotentiostat, the second channel can be controlled at a independent constant potential, to scan or step at the same potential as the first channel, or to scan with a constant potential difference with the first channel. Techniques available for the second channel include CV, LSV, SCV, CA, DPV, NPV, SWV, and i-t.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Comparing with the previous model 700E series, the new series provide higher speed data acquisition, higher speed of communication, higher frequency impedance measurements, both positive feedback and current interruption iR compensation, and some new techniques, such as Potentiometric Intermittent Titration Technique (PITT) and Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT).</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 10 or 11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbarallows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">This model series includes a USB port for data communication with the PC. </span><span class="ts1">Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">Highly stable 16-bit bias circuitry is used for current and potential bias, allowing a wider dynamic range in AC measurements. This can also be used to re-zero the DC current output.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Compared with the previous model 700E series, the 700F has faster data acquisition (from 1MHz to 2.5MHz), faster data transfer (3x) between the PC and instrument, higher frequency for impedance measurements (from 1MHz to 3MHz). The current-interrupt iR compensation is added.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">This model series also includes a true integrator for chronocoulometry, and is capable of waveform update at 10 MHz and data acquisition at 2.5 MHz with 16-bit resolution and low noise. When used as a single-channel potentiostat, the instrument is identical to the model 600F series. When it is used as a bipotentiostat, the second channel can be controlled at a independent constant potential, to scan or step at the same potential as the first channel, or to scan with a constant potential difference with the first channel. The second channel is available for many voltammetric and amperometric techniques. </span></p>
