<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The model 1100C series power potentiostat / galvanostat is designed for electrochemical applications that require relatively large current and high compliance voltage, such as battery studies, corrosion, electrolysis, and electroplating. The potential control range is ±10 V, the current range is ±2 A, and the compliance voltage is ±25 V. The system contains a high speed digital function generator, a fast data acquisition system, current signal filters, iR compensation circuitry, a potentiostat, and a galvanostat (1140C only). The function generator can update at a 10 MHz rate, and the maximum sampling rate is 1 MHz at 16-bit resolution. The 1100C series is capable of measuring current down to tens of picoamperes. The steady state current of a 10 μm disk electrode can be readily measured without external adapters. he instrument provides a very wide dynamic range of experimental time scales. For instance, the scan rate in cyclic voltammetry can be up to 1,000 V/s with a 0.1 mV potential increment, or 5000 V/s with a 1 mV potential increment. The potentiostat/galvanostat uses a 4-electrode configuration, allowing it to be used for liquid/liquid interface measurements and eliminating the effect of the contact resistance of connectors and relays for high current measurements. The data acquisition systems allow an external input signal (such as spectroscopic) to be recorded simultaneously with electrochemical data.</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The multiplexed data acquisition system of the instrument allows an external input, such as a spectroscopy signal, to be recorded simultaneously with electrochemical data. The instrument will also automatically re-zero both potential and current to compensate for hardware drift due to temperature and time, making periodic re-calibration of the instrument unnecessary.</span></p>

<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, context sensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series includes a USB port for data communication with the PC. Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
