<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 1600 series 8-channel potetniostat/galvanostat is designed for battery testing. It has eight independent channels for a maximum current at ±3A (depending on the cell loading) per channel. The potential range is ±5V. The sampling rate is fixed at 5 Hz. You can start a channel first and the other channels later. Any channel can be stopped at any time while other channels are still running.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">There are two models in the model 1600 series. The CHI1600 will allow slow cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, amperometric i-t curve, chronopotentiometry for constant current battery charge/discharge, and open circuit potential versus time. The CHI1610 adds multi-potential steps and multi-current steps to the CHI1600.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 1600 series has a same user interface as our other instrument series. It therefore has nearly all software features and the very similar user interface as our other instruments. The data format is also compatible. </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The major difference in user interface is that there are eight channel number (1-8) buttons and a All (channels) button on the toolbar. At any time, if you click a button for a channel number, it will display the data of this channel, you can read a data file in to this channel, or save the data of this channel to disk. You can also change technique, parameters of this channel. When you set parameters of this channel, you can also set same parameters for other channels that are not running experiment for convenience. The All button will display data for all channels. With All button pressed, you can click run, it will then run all channels that are not currently running (but one at a time). If you click Stop, it will stop all channels.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">You can switch to a different channel or to all channels at any time, by pressing the toolbar channel button. Double clicking the data graph when all channels are selected, or when this particular channel is selected and running experiment, will toggle from all channels to single channel or vice versa. If a channel is selected but not running, you have to press the toolbar channel button to switch to other channel or to all channels.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument regularly send data to the PC every 0.2 seconds. There is a watchdog in the CPU that if the program does not get back to sampling loop for more than 0.2 second, the instrument will reset as just turn the power on. Obviously, data sending is stopped. If the PC senses the data is not received for more than 0.2 second, it knows that something wrong with the instrument. Under this condition, the PC software will save all running channel data to binary data files using the binary data format that can be read back later. Since the instrument will recover to startup conditions due to watchdog function, the PC software will try to handshake with the instrument. If correct response is received, the PC will re-start run for all unfinished channels. for instance, if the instrument power is lost momentary, when the power is on again, the data before instrument halt are saved and the new experiments for all unfinished channels start.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. It is easy to install and use. The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications, you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, context-sensitive help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional features include color, legend and font selection, data interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer. </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series includes a USB port (default) and a serial port for data communication with the PC, with switching capabilities on the rear panel of the instrument. Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately. </span></p>
