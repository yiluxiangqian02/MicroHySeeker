<p class="ps5"><span class="ts4">Important Note</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">After you unpack the instrument, please check the contents of the shipment carefully. You should find the instrument, USB cable, electrode leads, and software CD. Electrodes and other accessories are sold separately; if you ordered electrodes and accessories, please thoroughly check the shipment and compare its contents with the packing list. If anything is missing, please search thoroughly inside the container, since the missing items may have been mixed with the packing material over the course of shipping. Please report any missing or damaged items immediately and do not throw away the shipping materials, as these may be used for return shipping.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts26">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts4">Software</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows 7/10/11. A USB port is required for communication between the instrument and the PC. Refer to your Windows system documentation to gain familiarity with Windows operation.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The software in-program documentation uses compressed HTML (.chm) files, which provide comprehensive context-sensitive help via the Shift+F1 keyboard shortcut and in dialog boxes. </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">You may consider to create a C:\CHI folder on your hard drive. To install the software, insert the software CD. Simply copy the &quot;chi####.exe&quot; (the program executable) and &quot;chi####.chm&quot; (HTML help file) files to the C:\CHI folder. You can also see some test data files (*.bin) on the CD. If the executable is copied or moved (say, to D:\My.Prog.exe) it must be accompanied by a help file with the same name (say, D:\My.Prog.chm) for the comprehensive context-sensitive help to be available. The program has been designed with ease of use in mind. It is self-contained and portable.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Double-click chi####.exe to start the program. The only file required to run the software and control the instrument is chi####.exe, which can be placed in any directory for which you have write and execute permission. This can be particularly useful in restricted user settings (teaching labs, portable installations on removable media, etc.)--simply copy the .exe file and .chm file to, say, the user's home directory.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The first time it is run, the program will automatically generate a binary configuration file (chi####.cfg) containing (virtually) all user preferences and settings. This configuration file will have the same name and location as the executable, and multiple instruments can be controlled using multiple copies of the executable, each with its own configuration file (e.g., chi660e1.exe + chi660e1.cfg and chi660e2.exe + chi660e2.cfg). Newer versions of the software will also generate chi####.ini, which harkens back to a kinder, gentler time when ini files ruled the electronic earth, untrammeled by the unreliable tyranny of the registry. Even now, our software avoids the registry completely, storing all settings in the .cfg and .ini files, streamlining the transfer of user settings between directories or computers to a simple file copy operation.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To uninstall the software, simply delete all program files: the executable (.exe), help (.chm), and configuration (.cfg and .ini). Since no settings are stored on the registry, an uninstaller is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The software CD also contains a hyperlinked, electronic copy of this User Manual and the USB Driver.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument communicates with the PC through a USB port. To use a USB port for data communication, you must first install the USB driver (included on the software CD.</span></p>
<p class="ps9"><span class="ts27">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">On the software CD, you can find the USB driver installation file in the &quot;CP210x_Windows_Drivers&quot; folder. You can skip the download and extract procedure below and go ahead the installation.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If you can not find the software CD, please </span><span class="ts3">download the USB driver from the following website:</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">http://www.chinstruments.com/openshare/USB/CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts22">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">Right click the file &quot;CP210x_Windows_Drivers.zip&quot; and select &quot;Extract&quot;, the files will be extract to a new folder &quot;CP210x_Windows_Drivers&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">To enable USB communication, please use the following procedure:</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">1. Make sure your instrument:</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- is connected to your computer through a USB cable that comes with the instrument.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- is powered on (if applicable)</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- has its USB switch on the rear panel flipped toward the USB port (if applicable)</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">2a. If your Windows is 64-bit, run the installer &quot;CP210xVCPInstaller_x64.exe&quot; and answer all prompts in the affirmative.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">or</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">2b. If your Windows is 32-bit, run the installer &quot;CP210xVCPInstaller_x86.exe&quot; and answer all prompts in the affirmative. </span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">3. Obtain your COM port number as follows.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- Find (My) Computer on desktop or in File Explorer, right click it and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- Find Device Manager on the upper left corner, click it.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- Please look for &quot;Ports (COM &amp; LPT)&quot;. If you can not find it, the USB Driver is not installed properly. Try again. If you find &quot;Ports (COM &amp; LPT)&quot;, then click it and find &quot;Silicon Labs CP210x ... COM#&quot;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts3">- Remember the COM number.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">4. Start the instrument program. Using the System command under the program Setup menu, assign the COM port number found in Step 3 and click OK.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">5. You are now ready to use the instrument. You may want to try Hardware Test under the Setup menu first.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Note that to use USB communication, you need to turn the instrument on before you start the program.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">USB is not a resident device. If you do not turn the instrument on first, the program will not see the USB or register the port, and it will issue a &quot;Link Failed&quot; message.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If you consistently encounter &quot;Link Failed&quot; messages, try a different PC. The instrument we delivered was turned on for a week and tested. In nearly all cases, consistent &quot;Link Failed&quot; messages are caused by the PC, either by port settings or problems.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">If you continue to encounter get &quot;Link Failed&quot; messages after all these efforts, please try a different</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">computer</span><span class="ts1">, you need to install the USB driver also</span><span class="ts1">.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts4">Hardware</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">System hardware installation is also easy and simple. </span><span class="ts5">After unpacking the instrument, you should check your power lines. The AC voltage of the instrument was preset in the factory and is indicated in the serial number label on the back panel.</span><span class="ts28">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">If the AC voltage is correct, connect the instrument to the power with the power cord.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Once the instrument and PC can communicate properly, you can connect the electrode leads to the rear</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">panel. The green clip is for the working electrode, white is for reference, and red is for counter. The black</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">clip is a sensing electrode. Please refer to the Appendix of this User Manual for a description of 4-electrode configuration and sensing electrode usage.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The Cell Control port on the rear panel can be used to control purge, stir, and mercury drop dislodge. It</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">can also be used to control external adapters, such as the CHI200B Picoamp Booster, CHI680</span><span class="ts1">C</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;Amp</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">Booster, CHI684 Multiplexer, etc. Please refer to the Appendix for more information.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Certain instrument models</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;are also capable of controlling a </span><span class="ts1">ALS RRDE-3A or Pine Instrument AFMSREC Rotator for RDE</span><span class="ts1">. Two banana jacks on the rear panel will provide a voltage of 0 - 10 V,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">corresponding to a rotation rate of 0 - 10,000 rpm.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">You are now ready to use the instrument.</span></p>
