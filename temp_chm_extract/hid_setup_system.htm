<p class="ps2"><span class="ts35">This command opens the </span><a href="hidd_dialog_systemsetup.htm" class="hs0">System Setup dialog box</a><span class="ts35">.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">Use this command to set up the serial communication port, current polarity, potential axis and current axis. You can choose any convention for the potential and current axis.</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts37">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">The </span><a href="hid_setup_system.htm" class="hs0">System</a><span class="ts35">&nbsp;command presents this dialog box.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span><img width="863" height="658" border="0" src="Images/Image(62).png" /></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The following options allow you to set up your system:</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Communication Port</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Select the PC communication port to which the instrument is linked. Available ports should be listed in the Windows Device Manager.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Com Port Speed</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Set the communication speed between the PC and the instrument. The Fast setting allows real time data transfer at higher scan rate and/or shorter sampling interval. The Standard setting is included for greater compatibility.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Current Polarity</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Assign anodic or cathodic current as positive-valued. This sign convention must be chosen before running an experiment; otherwise, experimental results (peaks, waves) will not be reported properly.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Potential Axis</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Assign left or right as the positive direction for the potential axis (only applicable to voltammetric or polarographic techniques).</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Current Axis</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Assign up or down as the positive direction for the current axis.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Line Frequency</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Select the correct (power) line frequency for your geographic region. This will reduce interference from the line frequency by adjusting the default sampling interval in certain techniques.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Windows</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Select the language used by your Windows operating system (Oriental covers Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Windows). The Technique selection field may be truncated if you select English Windows. Oriental Windows uses shows slightly bigger letters than English Windows, and does not support certain symbols. For instance, the symbol &quot;μ&quot; may not be displayed properly in Oriental Windows. When set to Oriental, the program will use &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;μ&quot;.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Data Length (requires program restart)</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The default data length is 256K. It is recommended not to use longer data length unless necessary. Using long data length will need large computer memory such as 8G RAM or more. Longer data length requires more computer resources, slows down your PC, and may prohibit other programs from running.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">After changing this setting, please exit and restart the program; otherwise the program may crash.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">If data is acquired and saved with a longer data length but read back with a shorter data length, the program may also crash. To prevent this, if the data length has been increased, it should not be decreased to a smaller value later. Please think carefully before you decide to increase the data length.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">ADC Calibration</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) calibration coefficients are stored in the instrument's non-volatile memory. ADC calibration is carried out in the factory before the instrument is shipped. Use this command only if you want to recalibrate the ADC yourself. To do so, simply click this button. If successful, the new calibration coefficients will replace the old one. Otherwise the old one will retain.</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts38">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts36">Save retrieve data during run</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">This option allows data to be saved on the PC hard drive during an experimental run. In case your experiment does not run to completion, e.g., due to external interference, interruption, or missed communication, data can be recovered partially. This is useful for very slow experiments; hours of experimental data can be recovered.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">For performance reasons, this command is not enabled by default. If a fast experiment is accidentally interrupted, it may prove more expedient to simply re-run the experiment instead of using the </span><a href="hid_file_retrieve.htm" class="hs0">Retrieve</a><span class="ts35">&nbsp;command, which is located under the File menu. </span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts37">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Auto data save after run</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">If this option is checked, the data file will be saved automatically. The filename has a form of 20160220_100623_CV.bin. It is the year-month-day_hour-minutes-second_technique. </span><span class="ts3">For the CHI1600, it also adds the channel number to the file name: </span><span class="ts35">20160220_100623</span><span class="ts3">_CH5_CV.bin. It means the data is measured at channel 5. </span><span class="ts35">The file is saved in the same folder as the instrument control program. This may take large disk space. Periodic clearance may be necessary.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts37">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Present Data Override Warning</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">If your experimental data is not saved before running a new experiment or opening an existing file on the disk, your unsaved data will be overridden. This option will allow system to issue a warning before the data is lost.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Save Text File As Well</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">By default, the program only saves binary data files, which contain extra system information (including experimental control information). This option allows you to save your data in text format as well whenever you save a binary data file. This is useful for exporting data to read into other software (e.g., spreadsheets).</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Check Com Port While Idling</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">If this option is checked, when the software is idling, the software will check if the USB or serial port is available. If so, put a &quot;COM OK&quot; prompt on the status bar, otherwise put a &quot;No COM&quot; prompt on the status bar.</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts37">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts36">Automatically Detect Com Port</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts35">If this option is checked, when the software starts, the software will scan the USB or serial port and assign the valid com # to the Communication Port. The communication port number selection is disabled. If the automatic detection does not work, one should uncheck this option and use manual com port selection.</span></p>
<p class="ps22"><span class="ts37">&nbsp;</span></p>
