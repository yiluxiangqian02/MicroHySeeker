<p class="ps2"><span class="ts35">The </span><a href="hid_control_secm.htm" class="hs0">SECM Probe</a><span class="ts35">&nbsp;command presents this dialog box.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Stage Reset</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Execute this command when the instrument is first used or if the positions of the stepper stage are lost. Before doing so, ensure that no tip is present in the tip holder; otherwise the motor move will cause the tip to be broken. </span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Clicking on the Reset button will move the stage to its home position, which is stored in memory, and then move it to the center position. After clicking on the Reset button, please wait for the operation to be completed.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The stage position will be remembered even after the motor controller is powered off.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Stepper Stage Moving Speed</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">When this value is below 32 um/sec, setting resolution will be 1 nm. As moving speed increases, setting resolution and accuracy will worsen, i.e., there is a tradeoff between speed and setting resolution. When the Max Speed box is checked, the motor will move at maximum rate with relatively low setting resolution. Please keep in mind that the stage may vibrate slightly when the moving speed is high. It is recommended to raise the tip at fast speeds to prevent the tip from touching the sample surface due to stage vibration.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Stepper Stage Position Set and Relocate</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Up to four positions can be defined by the user for quickly changing the stage position. Click the corresponding Set button to memorize the current position as one of these points; click the Goto button to move the stepper stage to the preset point.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Stepper Stage Position</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The stepper motor position is continuously updated while this dialog box is open. Click the Zero button to re-zero the relative position of the corresponding axis at any time. Click the Move button of the corresponding axis to move the stepper motor to the specified position in absolute or relative coordinates. If the requested move hits the zero or full range limit, a warning will be issued.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">You can also use the scroll bar to move the stepper motor. Every click on the left or right arrow on the scroll bar will move 1/100 of the full scale. If you click and hold down the left or right arrow, after finishing the last move, the system will move in the requested direction until you release the mouse button. This is useful for moving the stage while watching the position.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Piezo Stage Calibration</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The Piezo block used in the Model CHI920D needs to calibrate its motor before the first measurement. Calibration is performed using the stepper motor because its travel distance is known.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">Please consult your User Manual for more information.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts36">Piezo Stage Position</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">The probe position is continuously updated while this dialog box is open. Click the Zero button to re-zero the relative position of the corresponding axis at any time. Click the Move button of the corresponding axis to move the piezo to the specified position in absolute or relative coordinates. If the requested move hits the zero or full range limit, a warning will be issued. The tip will stop at zero or full range.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">You can also use the scroll bar to move the piezo. Every click on the left or right arrow on the scroll bar will move 1/100 of the full scale.</span></p>
<p class="ps17"><span class="ts35">&nbsp;</span></p>
