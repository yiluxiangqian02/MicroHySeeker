<p class="ps14"><span class="ts7">The scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) was introduced in 1989</span><span class="ts21">1 </span><span class="ts7">as an instrument that could</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">examine chemistry at high resolution near interfaces. By detecting reactions that occur at a small</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">electrode (the tip) as it is scanned in close proximity to a surface, the SECM can be employed to obtain</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">chemical reactivity images of surfaces and to make quantitative measurements of reaction rates.</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">Numerous studies with the SECM have now been reported from a number of laboratories all over the</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">world and the instrument has been used for a wide range of applications, including studies of corrosion,</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">biological systems (e.g., enzymes, skin, leaves), membranes, and liquid/liquid interfaces.</span><span class="ts21">2 </span><span class="ts7">The trapping</span><span class="ts7">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts7">and electrochemical detection of single molecules by SECM has also been reported.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 900D/920D Scanning Electrochemical Microscope consists of a digital function generator,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">bipotentiostat, high-resolution data acquisition circuitry, three-dimensional nanopositioner, positioner</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">controller, and a sample/cell holder, as shown in the Figure below. The three dimensional nanopositioner</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">has a spatial resolution of nanometers and allows a maximum traveling distance of several centimeters.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">The potential control range of the bipotentiostat is ±10 V and the current range is ±250 mA. The</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">instrument is capable of measuring current in the picoampere range.</span></p>
<p><img width="809" height="506" border="0" src="Images/Image(42).png" /></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The model 900D/920D is designed for scanning electrochemical microscopy, but is also capable of</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">many conventional electrochemical techniques for convenience.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Model 900D uses a stepper motor positioner that can travel 50 mm with 8 nm resolution. The Model</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">920D combines the stepper motor positioner with a three dimensional closed-loop piezo positioner.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">Model 900D/920D is an upgrade to the 900B/910B SECM. The stepper positioner has better linearity</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">and resolution (8 nm versus 100 nm) and longer travel distance (50 mm versus 25 mm). Also, waveform</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">generation and data acquisition are significantly faster. The waveform update rate can be 10 MHz andthe sampling rate can be 1 MHz at 16-bit resolution, while maintaining low noise levels. AC</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">measurement techniques including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have also been added.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">Improvements also include very stable and accurate potential and current control, and dual-channel data</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">acquisition at high speed.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument can be controlled by any PC running Windows </span><span class="ts1">7/10/11</span><span class="ts1">. It is easy to install and use.</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">The user interface uses the classic Microsoft design, so if you are familiar with Windows applications,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">you can likely use the software without referring at all to this user manual or the comprehensive, contextsensitive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">help files that are included with the instrument software. The commands, parameters, and</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">options have been written using terminology that most chemists are familiar with. A customizable toolbar</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">allows quick access to the most commonly used commands.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">The instrument provides many powerful functions, such as straightforward file handling, extensive</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">experimental control, flexible graphics, various data analyses, and efficient digital simulation. Additional</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">features include macro commands, working electrode conditioning, color, legend and font selection, data</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">interpolation, visual baseline correction, data point removal, visual data point modification, signal</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">averaging, Fourier spectrum, and a convenient technique-specific electrochemical equation viewer.</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts2">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="ps5"><span class="ts1">This model series includes a USB port (default) and a serial port for data communication with the PC,</span><span class="ts1">&nbsp;</span><span class="ts1">with hot-switching capabilities available on the rear panel of the instrument. </span><span class="ts1">Firmware is stored in flash memory, and as a result, instrument firmware upgrades can be transferred electronically and installed immediately.</span></p>
